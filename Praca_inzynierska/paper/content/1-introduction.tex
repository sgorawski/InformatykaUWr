\chapter{Introduction}

Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange,
history of which can be traced back to 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto's
Bitcoin white paper was published \cite{bitcoin-white-paper}.
Since that time the blockchain technology
Bitcoin was based on has gained a significant popularity,
giving birth to a huge number of different projects.
Tha applications of it are various,
this thesis will be focused on the most widespread one -- cryptocurrency.

Since 2008 the technology has significantly evolved,
and with three distinct blockchain generations being distinguished \cite{blockchain-generations}
and over 2300 various cryptocurrencies available over the internet \cite{cryptocurrency-list},
it may seem challening to comprehend.
With such a vast array of different digital assets for the users to exchange,
wrapping one's head around them is likely a non-trivial task.

This project aims to provide a partial solution by creating
an application for cryptocurrency wallets management
-- an unified interface for performing common financial operations
across different blockchains.
Chosen for this purpose were Bitcoin and Ethereum \cite{ethereum-white-paper},
belonging respectively to first and second generation,
as popular choices among users \cite{currencies-popularity} which together should provide
a comprehensive overview of the technology as a whole.
