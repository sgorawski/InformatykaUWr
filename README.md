Materials and task solutions for my Computer Science studies at the University of Wroc≈Çaw.

This repository contains mostly solutions for practical problems which required writing code.

Materials from term 1 are mostly nonexistent,
these from term 2 are a mess which I'm not likely to maintain,
but from term 3 and above everything should be quite clear.

Courses I've taken so far:

### Term 1:
